/*
BST Search
**********

Given a binary search tree rooted at "root" (as given in search function below), 
you are required to check if the given "key" exists in the tree.
Return 1 if key exists in the tree else return 0;
Complete the implementation of the search function in Q3_easy class.
You may add your own functions here if you require.

Sample Test Case:
=================
Three elements are inserted in the order as 
1
2
7

key is 2

expected return 1
